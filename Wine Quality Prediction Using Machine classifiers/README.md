This repository basically explores the prediction of wine quality using R programming language.

Notes:

1. Analyzed various Machine Learning approaches to predict the quality of a wine based on the physio-chemical 
properties by implementing SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, Neural Networks, Linear and Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA, KNN, 
Decision Tree, and Random Forest. 
2. Cross validation, Bagging and AdaBoosting methods were used to improve the accuracy.
